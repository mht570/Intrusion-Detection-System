In recent years, there has been a revolutionary change in the field of networking, use of the internet is growing day by day and so is the risk of intrusion. Nowadays, it is very crucial to have a secure network because of increasing dependability on the internet and to achieve high-level security \citep{A3}. One of the possible ways is through the intrusion detection. Intrusion detection is an efficient technique, which aims to identify various network attacks and further classify these network attacks into several categories. Presently, the web is broadly utilized in various organizations and the business prerequisites have caused enterprises to convey their very own data frameworks on the web [2]. Due to large dependability on an information system, it became a major bottleneck, and thus the primary target for the intruders.
